# Kristofer Sell - Software Developer with creative experience

## About me
**Hello!** 

I'm glad you took your free time to check out my repository! I'm Kristofer Sell and  currently on my new spiritual journey to broaden my horizons in _Software development_. I started with programming back in 2020 with experimenting in console applications in both C# and C++ and later decided to get into _Game Development_.
